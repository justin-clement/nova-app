                <li><p><b style={{color: "#123499"}}>Greed is Your Enemy:</b> What is greed? Greed is simply craving more for more's sake. Take 
                this example: Someone has N2000. In the process of betting, they're able to make an additional N16,000, 
                bringing their total cash to 18,000. However, the person is now immediately thinking of turning 
                that N18,000 into 36,000, without pausing to appreciate or understand that they previously had just 2K 
                moments ago, and they are now much better off with 18K. However, because they want even more, they 
                rebet, and 18K turns to N600. It's good to make a profit, but it's even better to apply wisdom. Before seeking 
                more, first appreciate what you have gotten. Buy something worthwhile. Pay a utility. Treat yourself. 
                Remember that greed is never satisfied, and ultimately consumes itself.</p></li>

                <li><p><b style={{color: "#123499"}}>Betting Is Not The Key to Long-Term Sustainable Wealth:</b> You <i>can</i> make money 
                betting. Sometimes really good money. But betting as a financial lifestyle is not sustainable. 
                Betting can be fun, and that's one of the aspects we care about: we'd like to make game weeks 
                a little more interesting, help you score some extra side cash. Just remember that's what betting wins are - 
                side cash. Please do not use important funds to bet (e.g. your house rent, school fees, travel funds, bride price). 
                Bet with only what you can afford to lose, because if dem chop you... you go cry.</p></li>

                <li><p><b style={{color: "#123499"}}>There's No Such Thing as a Sure Game:</b> Quantum physics 
                is currently the world's most accurate descriptor of our physical reality, 
                and one of the main things it showed is that reality is probabilistic by 
                nature. In the words of Stephen Hawking, the theory "does not predict a 
                single definite result... Instead, it predicts a number of different 
                possible outcomes and tells us how likely each of these is." This is why 
                upsets can happen in football. It's all about possibilities, and the likelihood 
                of these possibilities happening. Try not to think in terms of "this team will 
                definitely win/lose/score", but rather in terms of "this team is likely to win/lose/score." 
                Simply put, you cannot predict in advance the specific possibility that will play out; 
                you can only say how likely they are to happen. And that's where Supernova's services come in. 
                We present you with the most likely outcomes of selected matches. </p></li>

                <li><p><b style={{color: "#123499"}}>Less is more sometimes:</b> As mentioned, it's all about probabilities. 
                You are likelier to forecast six or seven games accurately than do the same for twenty games. The 
                more selections you add, the lower your odds of getting all correct. At the same time, low odds don't 
                guarantee success, just as high odds don't guarantee failure. However, try for balance, and recall that generally, the less 
                games in your bets, the better your chances.</p></li>

                <li><p><b style={{color: "#123499"}}>Examine Your Intuition, Know When to Trust It:</b> What we offer at Supernova 
                are recommendations, not predictions. We are meant to inform your betting choices, not choose for you. For instance, 
                when we fed the PSG - Inter Champions League Final through the ARCTURUS system before the game, it outputted 
                "Under 3.5 goals" as well as "Both Teams not to Score". PSG went on to win the match 5-0, 
                so Under 3.5 was a bust. Yet, both teams did not score. How then do you know in advance what recommendation to 
                go with? This is why we suggest trusting your good intuition: go with recommendations you resonate with or 
                feel a vibe of possibility with more.</p></li>
